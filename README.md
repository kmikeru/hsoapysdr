# hsoapysdr
Very simple Haskell wrapper around SoapySDR library
I liked the idea of SDR library by Adam Walker (https://github.com/adamwalker/sdr), but wanted support for other hardware types like HackRF and LimeSDR Mini, so I put together this crude stuff.

Only tested on Debian x86-64 with bundled GHC 8.6.5.
I still have no idea what I'm doing. (c)
